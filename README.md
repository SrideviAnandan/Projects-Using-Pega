HARDWARE SIZING APPLICATION USING PEGA 

Scenario:
The IT department for the Areteans is tired of sizing hardware requirements for the numerous PRPC applications the business wishes to implement.

Requirements:
They have decided to build an application that will:
	Allow	users	to	enter	basic	information	about	the application they wish to build
	Use a rules engine to determine the most appropriate hardware
	Allow users to decide if they wish to purchase the hardware
	Send the order to the fulfillment team if the user decides to purchase the hardware.
	Manage the Risk Mitigation process While the initial implementation will be for the IT Department, it is envisioned that this application will be used within other departments after the initial deployment, with minor specialization
